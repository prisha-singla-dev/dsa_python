# DSA Practice Log

## Day 1(Jan 3,2026)

### Problems Solved
1. ✅ Two Sum (Easy) - 15 min
   - Pattern: Hashmap for O(1) lookup
   - Real-world: Caching logic

2. ✅ Contains Duplicate (Easy) - 10 min
   - Pattern: Set for uniqueness check
   
3. ✅ Valid Anagram (Easy) - 20 min
   - Pattern: Counter/frequency map
   
### Key Learnings
- Hash maps are everywhere in interviews
- Similar to caching (key → value lookups)
- Time complexity matters (O(n) vs O(n²))

### Next Session
- Focus on: Sliding window problems
- Target: 3 more medium problems
