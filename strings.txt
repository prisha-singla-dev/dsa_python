A string is just a sequence of characters.
s = "cat"

Think of it like a list:
c   a   t
0   1   2

You can:
-loop over it
-compare characters
-count characters


Two words are anagrams if:
they use the same letters
the same number of times
order does NOT matter

Example:
s = "listen"
t = "silent"

Rule 1 - check length ; if length diff - no anagram
Counter is just a ready-made frequency counter->character → how many times it appears
