# DSA Practice - Python

My daily DSA practice for AI Engineer interview prep.

## Goal
- Solve 50 problems by Feb 1, 2026
- Focus: Arrays, Hash Maps, Strings (most common in AI roles)
- Track progress and patterns

## Progress
- **Week 1:** 3/50 problems solved ✅
- **Current streak:** 1 day
- **Total time:** 45 minutes

## Problems by Category

### Arrays & Hash Maps (3 solved)
- [x] Two Sum (Easy) - 20 min
- [x] Valid Anagram (Easy) - 15 min
- [x] Contains Duplicate (Easy) - 10 min
- [ ] Best Time to Buy/Sell Stock (Easy) - Tomorrow
- [ ] Longest Substring Without Repeating (Medium) - Tomorrow

### Strings (0 solved)
- [ ] Coming soon...

### Sliding Window (0 solved)
- [ ] Coming tomorrow...

## Key Patterns Learned
1. **Hash Map Lookup** - O(1) access (used in caching)
2. **Frequency Counting** - Character/element counting
3. **Set Operations** - Uniqueness checks

## Real-World Connections
Every pattern I learn maps to my LLM Cost Firewall project:
- Hash maps → Cache implementation
- Frequency counting → Query complexity analysis
- Set operations → Duplicate detection
